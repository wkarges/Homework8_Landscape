#Particle Quiz Project
##Description
This project was completed in class using no external reasources other than the Open Frameworks documentation.  The project uses the ofmesh class to draw a 30x30 plane onto a 3d space.  It then uses the ofSignedNoise function to set the value of z verticies on the mesh to a random number between 0 & 1.  This creates a series of triangular bumps on the mesh plane.
